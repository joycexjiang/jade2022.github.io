# Overview
[Jumpstarting Aspiring Developers and Entrepreneurs (JADE)](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/jade) is a week long immersive program for first-year students of all backgrounds in the U.S. tech and startup ecosystem. Through virtual and in-person visits and discussions with companies of varying sizes that span numerous industries, students will gain insight into the growth of startups and how they can dive into the tech and entrepreneurship space. Web development lessons will guide participants in acquiring tangible skills through building their own websites. By meeting and networking with founders, investors, company employees and JADE alumni, participants will learn how these skills can translate into future professions.

In previous years, JADE participants have been hosted by companies such as Google, Facebook, Spotify, New York Times, Flatiron Health, General Catalyst and Rent the Runway.
